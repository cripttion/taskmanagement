Assignment:
Objective:
Design and implement a scalable web application using the MERN stack while integrating AWS services. This assignment aims to assess your creativity, problem-solving skills, and proficiency in both frontend and backend development within a limited timeframe.

Project Overview:
Create a simple task management application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. The application should have the following features:

1. Authentication:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user access.
   - Allow users to register, log in, and log out.

2. Task Management:
   - Users should be able to create tasks with a title, description, and due date.
   - Tasks should be listed on the main page with basic information.
   - Implement functionality to edit and delete tasks.

3. AWS Integration:
   - Integrate AWS services for storage. Tasks should be stored in an AWS DynamoDB database.
   - Use AWS Lambda for serverless processing (e.g., task validation before saving).

4. Frontend:
   - Design a clean and user-friendly interface using React.js.
   - Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.

5. Backend:
   - Develop RESTful APIs and microservices using Node.js and Express.js for task CRUD operations.
   - Implement error handling and validation for API requests.

6. Security and Compliance:
   - Ensure compliance with security protocols and best practices.
   - Implement encryption for sensitive information.

Requirements:
- Utilize MongoDB for user authentication and store user-related data.
- Use AWS RDS for storing additional application-related data.
- Implement proper error handling and provide meaningful error messages.
- Write unit tests for critical functions.
- Ensure the application is deployed and accessible online.
